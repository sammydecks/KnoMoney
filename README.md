1. Install `pip install psycopg2-binary` and `postgresql` in virtual environment
2. Create AWS database and update settings.py (Following already done!)
3. Edit inbound rules to connect django application to postgreSQL application
4. Migrate database files to postgreSQL with `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Can add superuser with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` (already created below to use!)

**Admin Account**

1. Start local host: `python3 manage.py runserver`
2. Write 'admin' in url name: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`
